A comprehensive study of Python programming on the Raspberry Pi Pico,
this involves utilizing MicroPython, a lean implementation of Python 3
designed for microcontrollers. 

Learning resources range from official documentation and books to online
courses and project-based tutorials, using Thonny IDE, Arduino IDE and
VS Code as the programming environments. 

Including experiments that will be reinforcing the theory and the 
necessary technical skills.

Basic electricity, electronic components and basic electronic circuits,
schematic diagrams, DC test equipment use, as well as other topics will
be covered.

This class will be challenging, you should find it interesting,
rewarding and worthwhile, an algebra-level math background as well as a
good reading ability is essential for success in this course.
